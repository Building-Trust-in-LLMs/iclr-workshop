    <h2>Competition 101</h2>
    <p>The logistic of this competition is very simple.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Input:</strong> A folder of images with invisible watermarks. In the Black-box Track, no additional information is provided. In the Beige-box Track, details about the watermarking techniques used are also included.</li>
        <li><strong>Output:</strong> Your task is to develop attacks to remove the watermarks while preserving the quality of the images. Submissions will be a folder of images after attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Submissions will be assessed based on the effectiveness of the watermark removal and the preservation of image quality, resulting in a composite final score.</li>
    </ul>

    We encourage participants to read <b><a href="https://wavesbench.github.io/" target="_blank"> WAVES</a></b> paper to know more details about the watermarks and evaluation.
    In this paper, you can also find <b>baseline attacks</b>.

    <h2>Warm-up Phase (July 31 - Aug 31)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Warm-up Kit:</b> <a href="https://github.com/erasinginvisible/warm-up-kit/tree/main", target="_blank">link</a></li>
    </ul>
    This is a preparation phase. No submissions are required.
    Warm-up kit provides example watermarked images and various metrics for evaluating attack potency and image quality.
    It helps you get familiar with the whole pipeline and prepare your attacks.
    <br><br>
    <b>Note</b>: The models, watermarks, images provided in the Warm-up Kit are for practice only. The development phase will use different ones.
    The final evaluation metric in the development phase will be based on the metrics provided in the Warm-up Kit.


    <h2>Development Phase (Sep 1 - Oct 31)</h2>
    This is the primary competition phase. The competition will be hosted on a submission platform (e.g. Kaggle).
    There will be two tracks (see <a href="tracks.html">Tracks</a> for details), and you can participate in both.
    Participants are able to submit attacked images periodically, and a leaderboard will be provided to track performance.
