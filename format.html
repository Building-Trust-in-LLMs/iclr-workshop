    <p><strong>Workshop Format:</strong> The workshop will feature five main components, introducing new ideas and engaging the community in discourse about trust in LLM models and applications:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 7.5mm; padding-left: 0; list-style-position: inside;">
    <li><strong>Invited talks</strong> from a diverse group of junior and senior invited speakers, followed by Q&amp;A sessions to better engage the audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Break-out discussion session (sponsored by Adobe)</strong> where small groups of attendees will discuss current and future directions in trustworthy LLMs. We will hand out initial prompts to kick off discussion, and we will shuffle discussion groups halfway through the discussion period. We will also provide coffee and pastries during this period, sponsored by Adobe, to attract a broad audience for lively discussions and also to help bolster attendance for the panel session afterwards. <!-- Bang comment: But the panel session is before the break-out discussion session according to our schedule. --></li>
    <li><strong>Panel discussion</strong> where panelists from diverse backgrounds and expertise will discuss the scope, future directions, and limitations of red teaming. <!-- Bang comment: Have we decided the topic to be red-teaming? --> Organizers will curate initial questions to stimulate conversation, with additional questions from the audience to ensure a dynamic session.</li>
    <li><strong>Poster session</strong> will enable researchers to present their work interactively, allowing attendees to discuss the posters with the authors and fostering networking and idea exchange.</li>
    <li><strong>Contributed talks</strong> where exceptional submissions and competition winners will present their work, showcasing cutting-edge research and practical solutions.</li>
