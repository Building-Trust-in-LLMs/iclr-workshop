    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to "Erasing the Invisible" at NeurIPS 2024â€”a cutting-edge competition designed to
        rigorously stress-test image watermarks. This competition is divided into <b>two tracks:
            Black-box Attacks and Beige-box Attacks</b>. It aims to validate the robustness of image
        watermarks under varying visibility conditions and attacker knowledge.
        Competitors will attempt to remove invisible watermarks while maintaining the quality of the images.
        Evaluations will be based on two criteria: the effectiveness of watermark removal and the
        preservation of image quality. This competition is inspired by the <a
                href="https://wavesbench.github.io/" target="_blank"> WAVES</a> benchmark.</p>

    <p><b>Prizes:</b> There is a $3000 prize pool!</p>
